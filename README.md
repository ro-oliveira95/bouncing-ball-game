# Bouncing Ball

Simple and fun project made in the early days of my dev learning journey.

This is a self challenging game inspired by the [Classic Helicopter Game](https://www.google.com/search?q=Classic+Helicopter+Game+Mobile). Control the ball and avoid hiting the red wall as long as you can.

## Features
- Writing purely with HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Some hard-coded non-optimzed improvised not-recomended physics logic ðŸ™ƒ

## Run

To play the game, simply open the [index.html](index.html) file and  
run it your browser.
